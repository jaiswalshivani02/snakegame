# Snake Game

This is a classic Snake Game implemented in Java using the Swing library. The game allows the player to control a snake that grows in length as it eats food. The objective is to avoid collisions with the snake's own body or the boundaries of the game screen.


## Features

- Simple and intuitive controls.
- Increasing difficulty as the snake grows longer.
- Score tracking to keep track of the player's progress.
- Game over screen with the option to restart the game.
  

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

2. Import the project into your preferred Java development environment (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).

3. Build the project using the build tools provided by your IDE.

## Usage

1. Run the `Main` class to start the game.

2. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement: up, down, left, and right. The game will automatically restart once the snake collides with an obstacle.

## Customization

You can modify certain aspects of the game by editing the `Constants.java` file. Here are some options you can customize:

- `BOARD_WIDTH` and `BOARD_HEIGHT`: Adjust the size of the game board.
